üöÄ LAUNCHING...

Here's how to get ready for the live demo:

1.  **Prepare Your Phones**:
    -   Have both an **iPhone** and an **Android** device ready.
    -   Install the **"Expo Go"** app from the App Store / Play Store on both devices.

2.  **Web Dashboard**:
    -   A browser tab will open automatically, but if not, navigate to:
    -   **http://localhost:3000**

3.  **Mobile App**:
    -   A **QR code** will appear in your terminal shortly.
    -   Scan it with the Expo Go app (or the Camera app on iOS) on **both** your phones to open the Flimmer mobile app.

This setup will allow you to demonstrate the full, real-time, cross-platform experience.
