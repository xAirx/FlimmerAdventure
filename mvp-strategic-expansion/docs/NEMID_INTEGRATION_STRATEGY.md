# NemID/MitID Integration Strategy

This document outlines the strategic importance, technical path, and cost considerations for integrating Danish NemID/MitID as a core identity verification feature for Flimmer.

## 1. Strategic Importance: Why This is a "Must-Have"

Integrating NemID/MitID is not just another feature; it is a foundational pillar of our commitment to trust and safety.

-   **The Ultimate Trust Signal**: It provides parents with the highest possible assurance that the adults on our platform are who they say they are.
-   **A Powerful Deterrent**: It dramatically reduces anonymity, which is the primary shield for bad actors and those who would prey on children.
-   **A Key Market Differentiator**: It elevates our platform far above competitors who rely on simple email or social logins, justifying a premium position in the market.

## 2. The Technical Path: How We Integrate

We will not build a direct integration ourselves, which would be complex and require significant security certifications. Instead, we will use a certified identity provider as a bridge.

**The Integration Flow:**
1.  **Firebase as Core**: Our app continues to use Firebase Authentication as its primary identity system.
2.  **Auth0 as the Bridge**: We configure Firebase to trust **Auth0** as a "Federated Identity Provider."
3.  **Criipto as the Broker**: We configure Auth0 to use a certified MitID broker, such as **Criipto**, which specializes in providing access to Scandinavian digital identities.

This creates a secure, certified, and maintainable chain of trust:
`Flimmer App <--> Firebase <--> Auth0 <--> Criipto <--> MitID`

## 3. Cost Analysis: Framing it as an Investment

The cost of this integration is not an expense; it is an **investment in our core value proposition.** There are two main components:

-   **Auth0 Subscription**:
    -   Auth0's pricing is typically based on Monthly Active Users (MAUs).
    -   **Ballpark Estimate**: Their "Essentials" plan often starts around ~$35/month for 1,000 MAUs, with costs scaling as we grow. Enterprise plans with advanced features and higher user counts will be more.

-   **MitID Broker Fees (e.g., Criipto)**:
    -   These services often have a monthly platform fee plus a per-lookup or per-user fee.
    -   **Ballpark Estimate**: This could range from a ~$100/month platform fee to ~$0.10 - $0.50 per verification.

**Total Estimated Cost (Initial Scale):** A reasonable starting budget would be in the range of **$150 - $500 per month** to support our first few thousand users.

**The ROI Calculation:**
-   **Argument for Investors**: "This $500/month investment is the price of trust. To recoup this cost, we only need to convert an additional **50 users** to a hypothetical $10/month premium plan. We believe a feature this powerful will drive significantly more conversions than that, making the ROI overwhelmingly positive."

By framing the cost this way, we show that we are thinking not just about expenses, but about how strategic investments in trust can directly drive revenue and user growth.
