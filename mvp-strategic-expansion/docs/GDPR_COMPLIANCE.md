## The GDPR Compliance Checklist

This checklist details our adherence to key GDPR articles. It is a living document that guides our development and is reflected in our admin dashboard.

| Article | Requirement | How Flimmer Solves It | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Art. 6** | **Lawfulness of Processing** | We only process data based on explicit user consent or for legitimate interests directly related to providing our safety service. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 7** | **Conditions for Consent** | Consent is granular. Users opt-in to specific data uses (e.g., AI Analysis, Location) via clear, separate checkmarks in the initial privacy modal and can revoke consent at any time in their settings. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 8** | **Children's Consent** | We will require parental consent for all users under the age of 16, verified through our planned **NemID/MitID integration**. | ðŸ”· Planned |
| **Art. 15**| **Right of Access** | The "Export My Data" feature in the parent's settings screen allows users to receive a complete copy of their data at any time. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 17**| **Right to Erasure** | The "Delete Account" feature is a hard delete. It securely erases all user data from our systems within a defined period. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 22**| **Automated Decision-Making** | We use AI for content moderation, but this is a **recommendation engine**, not a final decision-maker. All content moderation actions that negatively impact a user (e.g., suspension) require a final human review, which is handled via the moderation queue in the admin dashboard. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 25**| **Data Protection by Design** | Our entire architecture is built on this principle. We use a secure BFF to avoid exposing the backend, and our Trust & Safety engine preemptively deletes harmful content before it's stored. | âœ… Implemented |
| **Art. 32**| **Security of Processing** | All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We leverage Firebase's world-class, ISO 27001-certified security infrastructure. | âœ… Implemented |

## MitID Integration: Cost Structure & Business Case

## The Video & Image Upload Flow (GDPR Compliant)

1.  **No Personal Data on Upload**: When a child uploads an image or video, it is sent to a temporary, isolated storage bucket and is **not** initially associated with their user profile.
2.  **Automated AI Scan**: The content is immediately scanned by our Trust & Safety engine (Google Cloud Vision).
3.  **Preemptive Deletion**: If the content is flagged as explicit or harmful, it is **permanently deleted immediately**. It is never stored, and no record is kept other than an internal security alert.
4.  **Association After Approval**: Only if the content is cleared by the AI scan is it then moved to our main storage and associated with the user's profile for parental moderation.

This ensures we minimize the processing and storage of potentially sensitive data and adhere to the principle of data protection by design.
