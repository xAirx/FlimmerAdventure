# Gamification Strategy: Beyond Cosmetics

The purpose of gamification in Flimmer is not just to monetize, but to **drive engagement with our core mission: promoting digital safety and positive family interaction.** Our strategy moves beyond simple cosmetic purchases to reward the behaviors we want to encourage.

## The "Diamond" Economy: Earning & Spending

Diamonds are our in-app currency. While they can be purchased, the primary way for a child to acquire them should be by **earning them through positive actions.**

### **How to EARN Diamonds (Mission-Aligned Actions):**
-   **Completing Safety Quizzes**: After watching a curated video, if a child successfully completes the attached safety quiz, they earn diamonds. *This rewards learning.*
-   **Getting Content Approved**: When a child uploads a video or image and their parent approves it, they earn a significant diamond bonus. *This rewards positive, safe content creation.*
-   **Positive "Vibes"**: If a parent marks a piece of content as "Especially Creative" or "Helpful," the child receives extra diamonds. *This rewards high-quality content.*
-   **Weekly Streaks**: If a child engages with a certain amount of educational content or completes all their safety challenges for a week, they get a streak bonus. *This rewards consistent engagement.*

### **How to SPEND Diamonds (Creative Expression):**
-   **Avatars & Profile Customization**: This is the baseline, cosmetic sink for the economy.
-   **Advanced Creative Tools**: This is the *real* driver. Diamonds can unlock:
    -   Special video filters and effects.
    -   A library of licensed, kid-safe background music for their creations.
    -   Unique "stickers" or animations they can add to their videos.
-   **"Gifting" to Friends**: Allow a child to spend a small number of diamonds to "gift" a sticker to a friend's video, fostering positive social interaction.

## The Parent's Role: The "Kudos" System

Parents are a key part of the gamification loop.

-   **Parental "Kudos"**: When reviewing content in the moderation queue, parents have more options than just "Approve" or "Reject." They can approve with "Kudos," which grants the child bonus diamonds.
-   **Weekly Summary**: The parent's weekly summary email can highlight the diamonds their child has earned and what they've spent them on, creating a positive conversation starter.

## The Business Impact

This model transforms our gamification from a simple revenue stream into a **powerful engagement and retention engine**:
1.  **It teaches children *what* we value**: safety, learning, and creativity.
2.  **It creates a positive feedback loop**: The child is motivated to create better, safer content to earn rewards.
3.  **It provides a compelling reason for a Premium subscription**: A parent might subscribe to give their child a "diamond allowance" or to unlock exclusive creative tools for them.

This mission-aligned approach makes our gamification a defensible and valuable part of the product, not just a tacked-on monetization scheme.
