# Monetization Strategy

This document outlines a proposed monetization model for Flimmer, designed to drive user acquisition through a compelling free tier while capturing value from our most engaged users via a premium subscription.

---

## 1. The Core Principle: Freemium

We will use a **freemium** model. A robust free tier is essential for building a network effect and allowing users to experience our core value proposition before committing to a subscription. The premium tier is what will make our business sustainable and profitable.

## 2. Proposed Subscription Tiers

### **Flimmer Free (The "Peace of Mind" Tier)**
-   **Goal**: Drive mass adoption and demonstrate our core value.
-   **Features**:
    -   Connect up to 2 children.
    -   Basic content moderation queue (approve/reject).
    -   Real-time safety alerts for high-risk events.
    -   7-day activity history.

### **Flimmer Premium (The "Proactive Parent" Tier)**
-   **Goal**: Generate revenue and provide maximum value to our most engaged users.
-   **Proposed Price Point**: $9.99/month or $99/year.
-   **Features**:
    -   Everything in Free, plus:
    -   Connect up to 5 children.
    -   **AI-Powered Insights**: "We noticed Emma is showing a new interest in chemistry. Here are some safe, educational videos about it."
    -   **30-day activity history** with search and filtering.
    -   **Advanced Parental Controls**: Custom content filters, screen time scheduling.
    -   **Location-Based Alerts**: "Jake has arrived safely at school."
    -   **Priority Support**.

## 3. The Business Case & ROI

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
-   **Conversion Rate**: What percentage of free users convert to Flimmer Premium? (Target: 5-8%)
-   **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: How much revenue does the average subscriber generate before they churn?
-   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: How much does it cost us in marketing to acquire a new user?

### **A Simple ROI Model for Investors:**

This is a simplified model to demonstrate the commercial viability.

-   **Goal**: Acquire 10,000 free users in the first year.
-   **Target Conversion Rate**: 5%
-   **Resulting Premium Users**: 500
-   **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: Assuming a mix of monthly and yearly, let's average it to ~$100/year.
-   **Year 1 Projected Revenue**: 500 users * $100/year = **$50,000 ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**

**The Pitch**: "Our model is not just about acquiring users, but about converting them by offering indispensable value in our Premium tier. With a projected $50,000 ARR from our first 10,000 users, we can demonstrate a strong product-market fit and a clear path to profitability as we scale."

## 4. Implementation in the Admin Dashboard

To support this model, I have already implemented a "Revenue" section in the **Business** tab of our Admin Dashboard. This section is designed to display these key metrics (MRR, Subscriber Counts, etc.) as if they were being pulled directly from a service like **RevenueCat** or **Stripe**, allowing us to monitor the health of our business in real-time.
